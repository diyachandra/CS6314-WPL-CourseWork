          <h1> About Me </h1>

          I am a Computer Science Graduate student at the University of Texas, Dallas. This is my second semester at UTD, and I find the coursework very engaging. My hobbies include painting, reading books and binge watching TV shows.I describe
          myself as an ambivert. I enjoying trying various cuisines, Tandoori Chicken and Biriyani being my favourite.
          <br>
          I have a work experience of 2 years with PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Limited, in a Technology Consultant role where I worked
          extensively with leading business
          intelligence tools like Tableau and MicroStrategy with background in database concepts.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the course of my career I have:
          <br>
          • Performed revenue leakage analysis for a leading Pharma company, reducing overall leakage by 75%
          <br>
          • Visualized regional sales patterns for a Retail giant which resulted in increase of regional sales by 8.5%
          <br>
          • Gained expertise in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) including requirement analysis, design, development, implementation, delivery and troubleshooting
          <br>
          • Developed a thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms
          <br>
          <br>
          I like to explore the relationships between numbers and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories.
          In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to
          make
          data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff.

          On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in
          my work; the only thing cleaner than my room are my spreadsheets.
          I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m
          comfortable
          on
          my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.
